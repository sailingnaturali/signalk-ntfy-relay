# Changelog

All notable changes to `@sailingnaturali/signalk-ntfy-relay` are documented here.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- **Delivery-path health check.** A proactive `/v1/account` heartbeat
  (`healthCheckIntervalHours`, default 24; token-only) plus reactive
  consecutive-send-failure counting raise `notifications.ntfyRelay.deliveryFailed`
  after `failureThreshold` (default 3) failures — so a silently broken push path
  (expired token, ACL, outage) surfaces on the dashboard/voice instead of going
  unnoticed until the next real alarm. The health notification is never forwarded
  to ntfy (no loop) and clears on the next success.
- `scripts/ntfy-doctor.js` — a CLI to diagnose the ntfy path (`check` / `test` /
  `poll`) without waiting for a real alarm. Dev tool, not shipped in the package.

## [0.1.2]

### Security

- Sanitise the outbound `Title` header before sending to ntfy. The title is
  built from the notification path and state; a CR/LF in a path could smuggle
  extra headers into the request or trip Node's `ERR_INVALID_CHAR` and silently
  drop the alarm push. Control-character runs now collapse to a single space and
  the title is length-capped. Defence-in-depth on in-process but untrusted data.

## [0.1.1]

### Added

- Initial published release. Watches `notifications.*`, edge-triggers on state
  change, and POSTs active alarms at or above a configurable severity to an ntfy
  topic. Zero runtime dependencies. Optional cleared-alarm messages and appended
  vessel position.
